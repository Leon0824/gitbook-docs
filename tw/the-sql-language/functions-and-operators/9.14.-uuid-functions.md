# 9.14. UUID Functions

PostgreSQL includes one function to generate a UUID:

```text
gen_random_uuid () â†’ uuid
```

This function returns a version 4 \(random\) UUID. This is the most commonly used type of UUID and is appropriate for most applications.

The [uuid-ossp](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/uuid-ossp.html) module provides additional functions that implement other standard algorithms for generating UUIDs.

PostgreSQL also provides the usual comparison operators shown in [Table 9.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-comparison.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISON-OP-TABLE) for UUIDs.
