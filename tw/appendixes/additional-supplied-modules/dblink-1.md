# F.10. dblink

`dblink` is a module that supports connections to other PostgreSQL databases from within a database session.

See also [postgres\_fdw](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/postgres-fdw.html), which provides roughly the same functionality using a more modern and standards-compliant infrastructure.
